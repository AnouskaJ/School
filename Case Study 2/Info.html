            The Apeejay Schools bear the motto "Shakti, Drishti, Prajyan". Our effort is to reach for the sky for 
            physical, mental and spiritual growth of the child and the pursuit of excellence in all these fields 
            is a relentless and a limitless quest. The schools strive to achieve peaks of excellence in the academic 
            field as well in life itself through a large variety of curriculum and co-curriculum projects. 
            Apeejay Schools help the child to learn while growing.
